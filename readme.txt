A companion plugin to WPLookout.com, which tracks changes and updates to the plugins and themes you depend on.

== Description ==

This plugin is an optional way to use WP Lookout, a service that tracks changes and updates to the plugins and themes you depend on. It sends information about the plugins and themes in use on your site to your WP Lookout account, where you can receive notifications about changes and updates.

It's free to [sign up for WP Lookout](https://app.wplookout.com/register). Once your account is active, you can generate an API key that gets added to the "WP Lookout" page under your Settings menu. That's it! The plugin will take care of everything from there on out.

By enabling a connection between your site and WP Lookout, you agree to the [WP Lookout terms of service](https://wplookout.com/terms-and-conditions/).

== Installation ==

WP Lookout is most easily installed via the Plugins tab in your admin dashboard.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

On a regular basis this plugin will send several pieces of information to your WP Lookout account via our API:

No other part of your site configuration or content is transmitted or stored. You can disable this connection at any time by removing the API key from the settings page, or by disabling or deleting this plugin from your WordPress site.
